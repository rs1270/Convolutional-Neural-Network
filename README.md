## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development Pipeline

### 1. Dataset Loading and Exploration
- Imported the dataset using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.datasets` or PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets`.
- Visualized a sample of the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- Analyzed class distribution to ensure a balanced dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Normalized image pixel values to scale them between 0 and 1.
- Converted labels to one-hot encoding where required.
- Optionally split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for better evaluation.

### 3. Data Augmentation
- Applied augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset diversity and improve model generalization.

### 4. Build the CNN Model
- Designed a simple CNN architecture with layers like convolution, ReLU activation, max pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
- Incorporated dropout layers to prevent overfitting and selected appropriate activation functions (ReLU) and optimizers (Adam).

### 5. Compile and Train the Model
- Compiled the model using a suitable loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.
- Trained the model on the training dataset and validated it on the validation set.
- Used callbacks like early stopping and learning rate reduction for efficient training.

### 6. Evaluate the Model
- Evaluated the model on the test dataset to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Plotted confusion matrices and learning curves (loss and accuracy) to visualize performance.

### 7. Save and Deploy the Model
- Saved the trained model for future use.
- Optionally deployed the model on AWS or another platform for real-world applications.

### Results
- Achieved good accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score with minimal loss, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in image classification tasks.
